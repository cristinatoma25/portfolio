# portfolio
Hi!
I am Cristina and you either found this portfolio while scrolling on Github or I sent it to you in my application. Either way, glad to see you taking interest in my work.
What you'll find here it's basically some of the projects that I either finished some time ago, or I am currently working on. These projects are, for now, mostly Python projects, regarding web development, database work or who knows what I will come up with.
Again, glad to see you here, and I'd be more than happy to recieve feedback if you will!
